				Time to get 'hooked' on crochet!

				The History of Crochet

				The art of crochet originated in the mid 1820's. It was most popular in England,
				though it's actual origins are unknown as it has been claimed by several cultures.
				Crochet was developed as a craft in the 19th century. Crochet is performed by using
				a hook to create interlinked loops of thread that become yarn made works of art.

				The term "crochet" wasn't coined in England until 1837. It was found in a knitting
				book called 'The Ladies' Knitting and Netting Book'. It was mostly in english, but 
				had one crochet pattern in it written in french. It only used the term once as it 
				is the french word for the word 'hook'.

				Why crochet?

				Crochet can be a very relaxing activity. While it may take some time to get the
				knack of it, it is worth taking the time to learn. There is great satisfaction of 
				turning a normal skein of yarn into anything from a snuggly children's plushie to a 
				soft blanket to warm winter beanie. It is a hobby that is worth giving a try!
